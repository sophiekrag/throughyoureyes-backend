# My life through your eyes

For my final project at Ironhack I've decided to make an app where parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, babysitters, etc. can write small stories about a childs life.

The backend is built with NodeJS and Express.
The state is stored in MongoDB and the images in Cloudinary.
